<body><h1> How to Learn a New Programming Language</h1>
<p>Consider the following approaches:</p>
<p>1. Read programming introductory books</p>
<p>You will learn some basic language syntax and usages from the book, meanwhile, write simple programs to practice what you've just learned.</p>
<p>2. Coding practice</p>
<p>After learning the basics, you could do some simple data structures or algorithm exercises. This practice makes you more familiar with language features.</p>
<p>3. Read open source project code</p>
<p>You would encounter unknown usages of the language in the source code, and then you could find the explanation from books or search engines. You adopt this approach largely because you want to understand the project's implementation quickly.</p>
<p>4. Implement your own small project</p>
<p>It is better to implement the project meeting your own needs. The project should have clear and specific goals. The project size should be moderate. You may encounter lots of challenges and difficulties in implementing. Try to solve them by reading books or searching answers from the internet.</p>
<p>The fourth approach is the best after I tried them all. It is the most effective and profound although it requires more consecutive time. When comparing all these approaches you will discover different learning patterns: Some are goal-driven active learning, and some are memorization-based passive learning.</p>
<p>The learning process is completely driven by goals when you're implementing a specific project. The biggest advantage is that you will come across real-life problems that make you aware of "unknown unknowns" and change it to "known unknowns". This is the essence of learning. Because the biggest risk of archiving a goal is you're absolutely unaware of something crucial. You're unable to make preparations and backup plans. This is the main cause of failure.</p>
<p>Solving the problems you meet in the project will gradually grow as your experiences. This kind of experiences is hard to gain through reading books. In fact, for any kind of learning, the primary is to identify problems, solving them is the secondary. Learning is inefficient when you fail to see the targets, and it's easy to get bored and hard to persist.</p>
<p>Understand your needs, define your goal, then identify and tackle the problems. This rule could be applied to learn not only a new programming language but also any other new technologies.</p>
<h1>如何学习一门新的编程语言</h1>
<p>一般来说存在以下方法：</p>
<p>1. 阅读书本</p>
<p>通过阅读，了解程序语言的语法知识，编写简单的代码熟悉语言特性。</p>
<p>2. 编程练习</p>
<p>在了解基本语法和特性之后，实现简单的数据结构和算法类习题。通过编写此类代码，进一步熟悉语言的用法。</p>
<p>3. 阅读开源代码</p>
<p>在阅读过程中会碰到不熟悉的用法，此时通过阅读书本相关内容，或者上网搜索，得到答案。这种方式一般是想 尽快了解开源代码的实现。</p>
<p>4. 实现一个小项目</p>
<p>最好选择自己需要的，并有明确而具体的目标。项目规模适当。在实现过程中，会碰到各种问题，通过阅读或者搜索解决方法。</p>
<p>这几种方法我都尝试过，方法4是最好的方法。效率最高，掌握程度也更深。缺点当然是需要比较集中的编程时间。 当把这些方法抽象成为一种解决问题的模式时，会发现它们之间的不同之处：是目标驱动式的主动学习，还是被动吸收式的学习。</p>
<p>在实现具体项目的时候，学习的过程完全是目标驱动的，最大的意义在于你会碰到实际的问题。实际问题的产生让你从 “不知道自己不知道” 变成 “知道自己不知道”，这个转变是学习的核心。因为想要达成任何目标，最大的障碍和风险就在于“不知道自己一无所知”，从而完全没有应对措施和准备。这是导致失败的最大因素。</p>
<p>在实现过程中，你会碰到在现实的项目中类似的问题，这样会给你带来实际的经验的积累。这种积累是很难通过阅读书本获得的。推而广之，任何学习问题的关键在于发现问题，其次才是解决问题。当你不知道问题所在时，学习是低效的，同时也容易变得枯燥，难以坚持。</p>
<p>了解需求，定义目标，通过实践发现并解决实际问题，这条存在先后顺序的规律，不仅适用于学习一门新的编程语言，也适合于学习任何新的技术。</p>
